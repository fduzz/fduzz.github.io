I am especially grateful to some of my high school classmates who have given me the most help and support. 

;In addition to studying and living side by side for three years in high school, we often traveled around the world together. I cherish the time I spent with them.

;We named this small group Zhangjiang University to express our gratitude to Zhang Jiang, our high school teacher, and to entrust our common ideals of academic and personal development.
