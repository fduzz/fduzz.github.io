I am especially grateful to some of my high school classmates who have given me the most help and support. In addition to studying and living side by side for three years in high school, we often traveled around the world together. I cherish the time I spent with them.

We named this small group Zhangjiang University to express our gratitude to Zhang Jiang, our high school teacher, and to entrust our common ideals of academic and personal development.


Zhang Zhou in the song, obviously not me, is originally of Vietnamese-Chinese descent and later naturalised as a refugee in Switzerland. Zhang Zhou's life has been marked by war and disaster, as his family moved through China, Vietnam, Malaysia and eventually Switzerland. He ended up working as a mechanic in a factory in Switzerland, living a quiet, traditional Chinese life.
