Above is my namesake song, from *Omnipotent Youth Society*, a rock band I really love.

Zhang Zhou in this song (obviously not me) was originally of Vietnamese Chinese descent, but later became a naturalised Swiss citizen as a refugee. His parents fled to Vietnam during the Sino-Japanese War, where he was born, and when the civil war broke out in Vietnam, Zhang Zhou fled with his pregnant wife from Vietnam to the Malaysian island of Bidong, where they were waiting to be taken in. Life on Bidong Island, which was home to 100,000 refugees, was difficult, with a lack of food, water, medicine and other supplies, and infectious diseases were rife. After 11 months on the island, Zhang and his wife and daughter were taken in by the Swiss government, and he became a mechanic in a Swiss factory. Zhang Zhou's family life in Switzerland is quiet, and he likes it. The food they eat, the dishes they use and the furniture they use have a traditional Chinese flavour. Zhang Zhou hopes that his daughter will find a Chinese man to marry and have a happy family.
