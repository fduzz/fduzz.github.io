Above is my namesake song, from *Omnipotent Youth Society*, a rock band I really love.

The man in the song, Zhang Zhou (obviously not me), is originally of Vietnamese-Chinese descent and was later naturalised as a refugee in Switzerland. He was born in Vietnam after his parents fled there during the Sino-Japanese War. When the civil war broke out in Vietnam, Zhang Zhou, with his pregnant wife, fled the country to the Malaysian Bidong island, where they had a difficult time. 11 months later, Zhang and his wife and daughter were taken in by the Swiss government, and he became a machinist in a factory in Switzerland. Life in Switzerland for Zhang's family is quiet and full of traditional Chinese flavour. Zhang Zhou hopes that his daughter will find a Chinese man to marry and have a happy family.
