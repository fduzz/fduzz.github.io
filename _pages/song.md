Above is my namesake song, from *Omnipotent Youth Society*, a rock band I really love.

The man in the song, Zhang Zhou (obviously not me), is originally of Vietnamese-Chinese descent and later naturalised as a refugee in Switzerland. Zhang Zhou's life has been marked by war and disaster, moving through China, Vietnam, Malaysia and eventually Switzerland. He ended up working as a mechanic in a factory in Switzerland, living a quiet, traditional Chinese life.
