I'm a PhD Candidate at School of Economics, Fudan University. I’m very lucky to be advised by Prof. [Zhao Chen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=H9oK5GkAAAAJ).

My research interests lie in understanding how various forces shape economic outcomes, with a particular focus on frontier technologies and government regulation.
