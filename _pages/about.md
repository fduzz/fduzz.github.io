I'm a PhD student in Fudan University, School of Economics. I’m very lucky to be advised by Prof. [Zhao Chen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=H9oK5GkAAAAJ).

My recent interests lie in digital economy and the development of emerging industries. I also follow topics related to political economy.
